Description:

Are you concerned about "forever chemicals" in your water, food, and everyday products?

PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of over 12,000 man-made chemicals designed to repel oil and water, found in everything from non-stick cookware to firefighting foam. But these "forever chemicals" don't break down in the environment or our bodies, leading to growing concerns about their impact on our health and the safety of our planet.

In this video, we dive deep into the PFAS crisis, uncovering the broken trust between corporations, regulators, and the public. We'll explain:

 * What PFAS are and why they're EVERYWHERE
 * The disturbing history of PFAS
 * The potential health risks associated with PFAS exposure
 * Evidence of research suppression and corporate cover-ups
 * What YOU can do to protect yourself and your community
 * Individual actions
 * Collective actions


We'll explore the ethical and regulatory considerations surrounding PFAS contamination, including the need for transparency, accountability, and stricter regulations to limit PFAS production and exposure.

Learn about ongoing research, innovative remediation technologies, and the long-term strategies being developed to mitigate the risks of PFAS. Discover how you can make informed choices, advocate for policy changes, and support organizations working to address PFAS contamination.
